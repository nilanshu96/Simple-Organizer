# Simple-Organizer
Example UI design for both Linux desktop and phones using GTK and libhandy.

This project is based on the tutorial provided by tuxphones ([link](https://tuxphones.com/tutorial-developing-responsive-linux-smartphone-apps-gnome-builder-gtk-libhandy-gtk-part-1/)) but uses C instead of Python.
This is a simple ToDo and Pomodoro timer app but with only the UI part. The functionality is still missing as I created this to see how libhandy can be used to create an app both for Linux desktop and phones.

It is made with the help of Gnome-Builder. The project can be exported as flatpak and tested in various systems. The best way to work on or modify this project is by using Gnome-Builder.
